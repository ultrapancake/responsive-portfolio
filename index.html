                My name is Glen Larsen, I am currently the meat department manager at Smith's Food and Drug Store in the Avenues, Salt Lake City Utah.
                I have been a butcher for 10 years now, 2 of which i have been managing my own shop. I absolutely love my job; however, I have reached
                the peak of my long term goals. I am looking forward to starting a new career where I am able to set, and achieve, both short and long
                term goals.
            </p>
